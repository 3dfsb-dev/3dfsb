Version 1.0 (07-01-2015)
************************

Major changes
-------------
- Extended audio and video support: more than 100 additional container formats and decoders are now supported through the latest GStreamer 1.4.3
- Better file identification: filetype is now determined by the contents of the file (with libmagic) with the extension of the file as a fallback
- High-resolution video previews: cranked up from the old 256x256 pixels to however high your graphics card supports (eg: 8192x8192)
- More fun: you can now zap away at your files with the lasergun tool! For your own protection, nothing is physically deleted from disk, unless you explicitly configure the program to do so.
- Video input device (eg: webcam) file previews: Video4Linux (V4L2) capture devices are now visible in the 3D world and can be viewed just like your movies!

Minor changes
-------------
- Faster navigation by default
- Visible on-screen info by default
- Uncapped framerate by default
- Uncapped texture size by default
- Higher rendering resolution by default
- Lots and lots of code cleanups and comments added
- No more dependency on libsmpeg

Performance
-----------
This version runs at 1920x1080 resolution while playing 720p H264 video (2048x2048 texture) on a single-core of the Intel Core i7 at 2.90Ghz.
