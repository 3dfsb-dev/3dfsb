Version 1.0 (07-01-2015)
************************

Major
-----
- More A/V formats: More than 100 audio and video formats now supported (through GStreamer 1.4.3) and there is no more dependency on libsmpeg
- Better file identification: filetype is now determined by the contents of the file (libmagic) instead of the extension in the filename
- High-resolution video previews: cranked up from the old 256x256 pixels to however high your graphics card supports (eg: 8192x8192)
- You can now zap away at your files with the lasergun tool! Nothing is deleted from disk, for your own protection :-)
- Video input device (eg: webcam) file previews: these are now visible in the 3D world, just like your movies!

Minor
-----
- Faster navigation by default
- Visible on-screen info by default
- Uncapped framerate by default
- Uncapped texture size by default
- Higher rendering resolution by default
- Lots and lots of code cleanups and comments added
- New maintainer (Tom Van Braeckel)

Performance:
------------
This version runs at 1920x1080 resolution while playing 720p H264 video (2048x2048 texture) on a single-core of the Intel Core i7 at 2.90Ghz.
